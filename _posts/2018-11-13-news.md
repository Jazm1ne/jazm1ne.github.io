### Deep-Brain Recordings May Show Where Unhappiness Lives

  
  Neuroscientists are coming closer to understanding why some bad moods seem to tumble uncontrollably through your head like a collapsing chain of dominoes. Psychiatrists have previously used MRI scans to probe the human brain and the world of emotions within it. This technology can show how brain activity changes within a few seconds, but the brain tends to work a lot faster than that—neurons can fire dozens of times a second.

One particular network connecting the hippocampus (an area linked to recollection) and the amygdala (an area linked to negative feelings) began appearing over and over, Sohal says. “That was our first big ‘Aha!’ moment.” Whenever these two brain regions created synchronized electrical pulses that fluctuated between 13 to 30 times a second, people reported their moods getting worse. “We basically found that when there is less activity in this network, mood is more positive. When there’s a lot of activity in this network, mood is negative,” Sohal says.

The finding brings scientists closer to understanding how the brain creates bad moods, says Brendon Watson, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the University of Michigan who was not involved with the study. “There’s a major open question in psychiatry: How do you construct emotion or mood? People have a very vague idea of what it means to perceive or have an emotion in the brain,” he says, calling the new study “a great step for neuroscience.”

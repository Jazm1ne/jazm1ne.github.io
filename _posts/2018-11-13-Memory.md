title: Earliest Memory 
---



  Recalling my earliest memory would probably be either going to a trip to the store or my 1 year party when I constantly fell with my short legs along recieving this stuff dog animal from my uncle. In the party my aunt gave me something strange to drink, which in a video shows a "Corona" maybe I disliked that's why I remembered yet i still wanted more.

Strangely walking I fell down all over the hall and outside runing away from people trying to catch me.
